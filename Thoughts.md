Things to do & Think about
==========================
- ids: do we need 'em? we could just use socket connections as 'identifiers';
since we don't have any form of login, people can't really get their id back anyway
- related note: if we have a prize and we lose connection, then we'll not be able to resume
(we'd have to ask for their name or email again, then we could reconnect)
- could use IP as identifier, but then that might change as well if they get disconnected
- could use mac address? that might be best, but can we get it?
